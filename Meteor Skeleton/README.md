Here Are Instructions to Start Your Own Meteor Project  
[Get Started with Meteor Here with Your First Project](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app)

Next You Will Want to Get Routes Set up. To Do so You Need Flowrouter  
[Here Is a Guide to Setting up Basic Routing Using FlowRouter](https://dev.to/damcosset/meteor-react-and-flowrouter-quick-setup-6g5)

To use this you will need to run  
* `meteor npm install` this installs missing dependencies  
* `meteor add kadira:flow-router` this specifically installs flowrouter  
* `meteor add twbs:bootstrap` adds bootstrap  
* `meteor add accounts-base` adds accounts
* `meteor add accounts-password` adds password support
* `meteor npm install --save bcrypt` adds bcrypt 
* `meteor add session` adds session state
* `meteor` runs app  

You will also may need to run:
`rm -rf .meteor/local` if this is in a new project and that file is copied somehow

      <p className='header'>About Me</p>
      <p>My name is Blake Richey, I am a undergraduate at The University of Texas at Tyler studying Computer Science. 
      My first year of college I realized I loved robotics and the general automation of things. I feel like this field
      has so much opportunity to help make the lives of everyday people easier. I spend most of my extracurricular
      activities progressing my knowledge of programming to hopefully one day further the advancement of the field.</p>

      <p>What interests me the most in my field are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Natural Language Interpretation. I 
      am a member of the Robotics Team at my university and have had the opportunity to develop an autonomous
      robot designed to solve problems that are both challenging and practically helpful. My most recent
      project was to develop a robot that could detect, retrieve, and identify objects through the use of computer vision
      then perform designated tasks, most commonly to deliver the object to a location which it would have to determine from
      surroundings based on the type of object it was. This required a persistent state manager, the incorporation of 
      various sensors that allowed it to perceive the world around it, and collaboration with various other individuals in
      various fields of study. While the project has been concluded and it was reasonably successful, I think the more I study
      the I will be able contribute to the field and one day to projects that will have significant impacts. 
      I hope to spend the summer advancing my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and developing environments that permit AI to
      interact with the world through the use of robotics.</p>

        Prior to attending college, I competed in Universal Interscholastic League competitions designed to 
        challenge high schoolers and develop a strong mathematical background. I ranked 2nd in the state in this 
        competition my senior year. 
        Lastly, I served my community by participating in my local Boy Scouts Troop. Progressing though this
        organization, after 14 years of active participation, I finally reached the highest rank of Eagle.
        As my project to contribute to the community, and the final requirement to attain the rank of Eagle, 
        I decided to collaborate with other community members and raise
        donations to provide a local food shelter with a fruit orchard that could be used to supply the homeless
        with food. After 5 months of collaboration, planning and assistance from the community, this fruit orchard
        was finally finished. The fruit orchard is standing to this day and is being used annually to provide food
        for the homeless.

        Beyond my professional and academic background and accomplishments, I am also a reasonably informed anime fanatic, 
        enjoy studying languages (both programming and natural), and enjoy travelling and nature treks. I am excited for 
        the opportunity at Argonne this Summer and hope to befriend a few people and network with others.

        My name is Blake Richey, I am a undergraduate at The University of Texas at Tyler studying Computer Science with a 
        focus on Robotics. I enjoy the general automation of things because I believe it can help people
        in significant ways and in general make everyday life easier, also because the feeling of completing a robotics
        project is exhilarating when it works correctly. My current Robotics experience consist of working on an
        autonomous robot, as a NASA Community College Aerospace Scholar, designed to navigate a simulated
        Martian terrain excavation mission. In addition to this, my most recent
        project was to develop a robot that could detect, retrieve, and identify objects through the use of computer vision
        then perform designated tasks, most commonly to deliver the object to a location which it would have to determine from
        surroundings based on the type of object it was. I will be working with Nwike Iloeje to produce an environment that
        will permit an AI to interact with the world through the use of robotics and optimize real world problems.
